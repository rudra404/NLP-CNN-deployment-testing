There is lot of misconception about efficacy of love that holds us back to generate loving feelings towards others. Love is not possessiveness. People look love as a possession that has to be acquired and preserved. To expect that others ought to provide it to us so that our life is filled with love is the biggest fallacy, which is cause of much unhappiness. It is not like any other material thing to be demanded from others. Even if other person offers us plenty of love, we may not be able to feel it. It is normal to blame others for not loving us, but much depends on our inner self whether it has capability to feel it from others. Love is a feeling of well being and of good emotions. It is an activity that keeps us in good spirit and is liked to our emotions. Let us engage and create feeling of love by making self capable through appropriate changes in our dealings with others. There is no other way to love and be loved. The physical intimacy devoid of good feelings is not love but lust. People often fail to conceive love as pious in essence. While dealing with others, let us take care that our dealings make them cheerful, by helping them to come out of their problem, appreciate their successes and be grateful for help received from them. All these activities are to express love. The benefit of giving love to others is that it appeals to our heart and makes us connected to others, provides stability and security, removes fear and gives a feeling of being good towards other people. One can get to know love by first generating such feelings of being good to others. How can a person feel love from others if he is filled with ego, anger and selfish tendencies? These negative emotions suppress inner urge to love others. Love is a divine energy. I had a very vague idea about love initially. As I tried to understand more about it, a completely different perspective and thinking develops that explains the true essence of love. I have come to know from spiritual literature that love is God and God is love. It appears too abstract in the first instance, but more we tend to think of God will make us to love God and all other creations of God. It is like energy flowing within us derived from Ultimate that thinks positive and helps in inner purification. Albert Einstein discovered energy mass equation that explains interconnection of material and energy. It revolutionized the thinking of present century by using a small amount of mass to derive a tremendous energy. Hence, along with our material existence, somewhere we are also part of the divine energy lying within us as dormant. Logically, this divine energy which is nothing but love brings us close to Ultimate. I can imagine that every one of us has a great capacity of this divine love within us, but it is hidden, untapped and misdirected. Great saints have worked on human beings from time to time by developing intense feeling of love and concern for others. This has helped them to achieve higher levels of spiritual growth and closeness with the ultimate. The true meaning of love is inner purification of soul. This is the real purpose of love.\"]\n",

The response time and throughput were measured to assess user experience. The first test which sent 100 requests in parallel to 2 workers took 41.78 seconds â€“ this is about 0.42 seconds per each request. This is an acceptable amount of time taken to generate an output from the app. Using â€˜ThreadPoolExecutorâ€™ and â€˜ProcessPoolExecutorâ€™ yielded similar results, and increasing the number of parallel workers up to 20 also did not affect the time taken per each request.

    "We evaluated the system's memory management capabilities to detect any memory leaks or inefficient memory usage that may lead to performance degradation or system failures over time. Memory management can be a complex task due to the many approaches being available. There is no one right way of taking care of memory of a system. We first observed the change in memory usage before and after sending the app 100 requests using a memory profiler. Two different functions were created for this which used different tools to measure the memory usage. Both times, the output showed that the system is using 0 MB of memory. This may be because the requests we are sending are short sentences and this does not really use a lot of memory. Heavier requests can be sent in the future, but we have the tools to identify memory leaks using these functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a memory profile decorator was added to the â€˜/get_sentimentâ€™ route of our app. This prints the memory usage per line of code for the app route to observe the memory allocation for various processes and get a better understanding of how the app behaves. To predict the emotion of an input text using the CNN model, we observed that a shorter sentence takes up slightly less memory than a longer sentence as expected. The application is not misbehaving here. However, it was also observed that upon restarting the application, the first request sent would allocate a significantly larger portion of memory to the same process. This can be kept in mind when considering redeploying the application after any updates. "
