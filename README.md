# Emotion Classification using a CNN
## Model deployment and endpoint testing
After performing experiments for classifying social media comments into 14 emotions using RNNs as seen [here](https://github.com/rudra404/NLP-RNN-Emotions-Classification), the project team decided to use CNNs because of slightly better performancce for the given task.<br />
This repo focuses on deploying the best solution, and building a pipeline that will train, deploy and monitor the model. The model (pytorch object) is not uploaded here, please send me a message if you need it!<br />

The jupyter notebook contains all the testing and results conducted on the deployed app.
